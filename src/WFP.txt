* *Status*: {status}

[abstract]
Abstract
--------
The *WebSockets Frontend Protocol* (*WFP*) is a transport layer protocol
for exchanging messages between Browsers and the Frontend WebSockets
Server implemented by the {webrocket}.

Language
--------
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <<RFC2119, RFC 2119>>.

Goals
-----
The purpose of the protocol is to allow for bidirectional, evented
communication between Browsers and Frontend WebSockets Server over
the <<WSP, WebSockets Protocol>> using the <<WSA, HTML5 WebSockets API>>.

Generalized architecture
------------------------
The Frontend WebSockets Server handles communication with the Clients
(Browsers) over the <<WSP, HTML5's WebSockets Protocol>>. Its endpoint
is combined up of a number of parts:

	[scheme]://[host]:[port]/[vhost]

[horizontal]
'scheme'::
	Will be 'ws' for a normal connection and 'wss' for a secure.

'host'::
	There is bound the server.

'port'::
	The port to connect to.

'vhost'::
	The virtual host to connect to.

.Example

	ws://webrocket.io/echo
	
Events
~~~~~~
The protocol implemented by {webrocket} defines two kinds of events: 
<<client-events, 'client'>> and <<server-events, 'server'>> specific.

[[client-events]]
Client Events (WebRocket -> Cient)
----------------------------------
[[client-custom-event-format]]
All client event messages MUST have the following <<JSON, JSON>>-encoded
payload format:

[source,js]
------
{		
    "eventName": {
        // ... parameters ...
    }
}
------

Parameter keys SHOULD be defined as camel-cased strings, to keep
compliance with the JavaScript coding style guidelines.

Two groups of 'client' specific events can be distinguished:

'System events'::
		Events triggered automatically by the Frontend WebSockets
		Server and sent to the Client. System event names MUST be
		prefixed with double underscore (eg. '__connected').

'Custom events'::
		User-defined events triggered by Backend Applications or other
		connected Clients. Custom events always contains the `channel`
		parameter in its payload.

IMPORTANT: The 'event-name' MUST be prefixed with double underscore for
	the 'system' events, and SHALL NOT use such prefix for the 'custom'
	user-defined events.

Connection established
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the connection is successfully established the Server sends an event
to confirm that situation with the Client. Message's payload MUST contain
unique identifier of the current session.

.Format

[source,js]
-----
{
    "__connected": {
        "sid": "session-id"
    }
}
-----

.Parameters

[horizontal]
'sid' [`string`]::
	An unique identifier of the current session.

[[client-succ-auth]]

the Server sends an event to confirm that situation. Message's payload
 MAY contain additional information about the authenticated session.

.Format

[source,js]
-----
{
    "__authenticated": {}
}
-----

[[client-confirm-sub]]
Confirmed subscription
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When connected Client has successfully <<server-subscribe,subscribed>>
to the specified channel the Server sends an event to confirm that
situation. Message's payload MUST contain the name of the subscribed
channel.

.Format

[source,js]
-----
{
    "__subscribed": {
        "channel": "chat"
    }

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The 'Presence channel' is a special kind of channel, which keeps track of
all Clients subscribed on it and shares that information across all other
subscribers. In that case, the message's payload MUST contain list of
subscribers' records with session identifier. The subscribers' records
MAY additionally contain custom data about related with particular
subscriber.

.Format

[source,js]

Errors
------
The {webrocket} error messages and codes are inspired by the
<<HTTPCODES,HTTP status codes>>. Here's the full list of possible errors:

[[err-bad-request]]
.`400`: 'Bad request'

The message sent by the client couldn't be understood due to
malformed syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request
without the modifications.

[[err-unauth]]
.`402`: 'Unauthorized'

Returned when invalid credentials given - user doesn't exist
in the system or secret key is not matching the specified user.

[[err-forbidden]]
.`403`: 'Forbidden'

The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it
due to lack of user rights. The request SHOULD NOT be repeated
until authenticate for as a different user or grant current user
with required permissions.

.`451`: 'Invalid channel name'

Name of the channel specified in the payload is empty or contains
invalid characters. The request SHOULD NOT be repeated without
the channel name modifications.

[[err-not-subscribed]]
.`453`: 'Not subscribed'

Channel is not subscribed by this client, so the operation on it
can not be finished. The request SHOULD NOT be repeated.

[[err-channel-not-found]]
.`454`: 'Channel not found'

Specified channel does not exist, so the operation on it can not
be finished. The request SHOULD NOT be repeated until the channel
will be created.

[[err-service-unavail]]
.`503`: 'Service unavailable'

The server is currently unable to handle the request due to
a temporary overloading or unpresence of the backend application
workers. The request MAY be repeated after short time.
