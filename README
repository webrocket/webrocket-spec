The WebRocket specification RFC
===============================

This repository contains sources of the WebRocket specifications.

Dependencies
------------
Before you build this specification you need to install the following
dependencies:

asciidoc
~~~~~~~~
Documentation and man pages generator
		
TIP: If you're happy user of shitty OSX, in case to make the 'asciidoc'
work properly you have to register the installed docbook.

	brew install docbook asciidoc
	sudo docbook-register

On any other normal Linux/Unix distribution it's enough to just
install deps with your favorite package manager:

	sudo apt-get install docbook asciidoc

Building instructions
---------------------
To build whole specification, simply run the following command:

	$ make

Generated files will be found in the 'www/draft/' and 'www/spec/' folders.
